<a href="usingrmarkdown.html" target="_blank">Unless you are using
RStudio</a>, you probably need to invest some time to set up your R
Markdown writing environment. In this document, I explain how to use <a
href="http://ess.r-project.org/" target="_blank">ESS</a>, <a
href="https://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/" target="_blank">
markdown-mode</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vspinu/polymode"
target="_blank">polymode</a> to write R Markdown documents with <a
href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/" target="_blank">emacs</a> on
Ubuntu.

### Installing emacs

Just install emacs using official repository:

```
$ sudo apt-get install emacs
```

If you have not already used emacs, getting to know emacs in itself will
be some kind of a challenge. I do not know what is the best introduction
for beginners, but it is often advised to take the emacs tutorial, which
is included in emacs itself. Just start the program - it is linked on
the start screen. Generally, emacs is not considered to be
beginner-friendly and getting accustomed to it will take some time.

### Setting up ESS

ESS is your R environment for emacs. "It is designed to support editing
of scripts and interaction with various statistical analysis programs
such as R" (<a href="http://ess.r-project.org/"
target="_blank">http://ess.r-project.org/</a>). It can be installed
through the standard package manager:

```
$ sudo apt-get install ess
```

### Setting up markdown-mode

Just by installing emacs and ESS you are good to use R in emacs. ESS
includes syntax highlighting for R and many useful keybindings
(e.g. evaluation of commands, functions etc.) among other
things. However, to write R Markdown documents in emacs you also need
support for markdown syntax highlighting, which is not given in the
blank installation of emacs. To get support for markdown syntax
highlighting, you need to install <a
href="https://jblevins.org/projects/markdown-mode/" target="_blank">
markdown-mode</a>. There are several possibilities to do so. For me the
following was the most simple:

Download `markdown-mode` from the github page (to do it like this you
need to install <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">
git</a>):

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jrblevin/markdown-mode
```

Add the path to the downloaded folder to your `.emacs` configuration
file, which is in your home directory (if it is not there, create a file
called `.emacs`; note that `.` files may be invisible in your file
browser). This ensures that emacs can use markdown mode. Thus, add the
following line to `.emacs`:

```
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/markdown-mode/repository")
```

Additionally, the following lines need to be added to your `.emacs`
configuration file to ensure that `markdown-mode` is loaded
automatically in emacs.

```
(autoload 'markdown-mode "markdown-mode"
   "Major mode for editing Markdown files" t)
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.markdown\\'" . markdown-mode))
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.md\\'" . markdown-mode))
```

### Setting up polymode

Alas, when installing `markdown-mode` will not give you syntax
highlighting for R code in your R Markdown document. To get both R and
markdown syntax highlighting in one document you need the `polymode`
emacs package to combine both. We will do the installation similar to
`markdown-mode`:

Download `polymode`, `poly-R`, `poly-noweb`, and `poly-markdown` from
Github:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/vspinu/polymode
$ git clone https://github.com/vspinu/poly-R
$ git clone https://github.com/vspinu/poly-noweb
$ git clone https://github.com/vspinu/poly-markdown
```

Add the following lines to your `.emacs` file to ensure that `polymode`
will be loaded:

```
(setq load-path
      (append '("/home/martin/git/polymode/"
                "/home/martin/git/poly-markdown/"
                "/home/martin/git/poly-R/"
                "/home/martin/git/poly-noweb/")
              load-path))
              
(require 'poly-R)
(require 'poly-noweb)
(require 'poly-markdown)
```

### Set up spell checking

You probably want to use a spell checker in your R Markdown writing
environment. Adding the following lines to your `.emacs` configuration
file will activate spell checking in `markdown-mode` by default: 

```
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'flyspell-mode)
(add-hook 'markdown-mode-hook 'flyspell-mode)
(add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'flyspell-prog-mode)
```

To select a default language dictionary (e.g. American English), add
this line:

```
(setq ispell-dictionary "american") 
```

It is possible to interactively change the dictionary used for the
current document by using the command
`M-x ispell-change-dictionary`. Press `return` and the type the required
dictionary, e.g. `german` (see
https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Spelling.html)

In this case, it may be necessary to install the required dictionary,
for example like this:

```
$apt-get install aspell-de
```

### Activate syntax highlighting for LaTex equations

When doing scientific writing with R Markdown, it will probably be
convenient to activate syntax highlighting for LaTex equations. The
following line in your `.emacs` configuration file will do the trick:

```
(setq markdown-enable-math t)
```

### Preventing line breaks in inline R

When I write documents in text editors such as emacs, I like to keep the
length of a single line short. That means, I usually write like this:

```
"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim
veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea
commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate
velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint
occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt
mollit anim id est laborum."
```

In this case, each line that I see actually corresponds to a single line
in the associated text file. Others however prefer to write like this:

```
"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum."
```

Here, the text editor (or in this case: the web-browser) will produce
"visual" line breaks, which means that your computer screen presents
several lines to you, but the paragraph is actually written as a single
line in the associated text file.

What option you chose is a personal preference -- I prefer the
former. In my experience the performance of text editors drops when I
have very long lines of text, but this may only be in my imagination. To
produce paragraphs consisting of lines of equal length, emacs offers the
`M-q` command, that is, press `alt` and `q` simultaneously and your
paragraph will automatically cut lines at a defined width (the default
is 72 characters I think).

The problem with this option is that when a line is split within an
inline R command after `r`, the command will not be executed as expected
when your R Markdown document is rendered. The reason for this is that
`M-q` cuts all characters behind `r`, meaning there is no additional
white space. The following command will not execute -- R Markdown seems
to interpret this as `rmean(1:10)`:


```
`r
mean(1:10)`
```

To counteract this unfortunate behavior, you can prevent line splitting
within inline R commands by adding the following code to your `.emacs`
file:

```
(defun odd-number-of-graves-this-paragraph-so-far ()
  (oddp (how-many "`" (save-excursion (backward-paragraph) (point)) (point))))
(add-to-list 'fill-nobreak-predicate 'odd-number-of-graves-this-paragraph-so-far)
```

### My .emacs file

After setting up emacs as described here, I obtain this <a
href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m-Py/m-Py.github.io/master/rmdsource/.emacs"
target="_blank">`.emacs` </a>file. Feel free to use any of it if you
like.
