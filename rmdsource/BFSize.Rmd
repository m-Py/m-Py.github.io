The usage of Bayesian statistics, and in particular the usage of Bayes
factors is on the rise in Psychology. Bayes factors allow to quantify
the relative evidence that data provide for two different hypotheses and
can therefore lend evidence to one hypothesis over another. In contrast,
traditional significance testing relying on *p*-values can only be used
to discard a null hypothesis, usually one assuming no effect of interest
(e.g. two group means do not differ). For various reasons, null
hypothesis significance testing has been criticizes for a long time.

Bayes factors have been advocated in Psychology as an alternative to
hypothesis tests relying on *p*-values. Bayes factors can be used to
answer the question as to how much a specified alternative hypothesis
describe the data better than the null hypothesis (however, it is not
necessary that one of the competing hypotheses is a null
hypothesis). When obtaining a Bayes factor of size X, you may say that
your data favor the alternative hypothesis by a factor of X in
comparison to the null hypothesis (you may not say that the alternative
hypothesis is X times more likely than the null hypothesis). The general
appraisal of Bayes factors seems to reach from "*they will save
statistical inference in Psychology from evil p-values*" to "*it is next
dangerous statistic that will be applied mindlessly and lead to bogus
interpretations of data*". However one may think of Bayes factors, given
their (as I assume) increasing occurrence in Psychological research, it
is probably useful to know how they behave under different relevant
settings.

In this post I therefore describe what Bayes factors you might expect
when varying the sample size and effect size. As is done often, I will
stick to the example of the independent sample *t*-test that compares
two means, and I will use the "default" Bayes factor proposed by
@rouder2009, which is implemented in the R package BayesFactor
[@R-BayesFactor]. This is also the model used in the statistics program
JASP. Note that my evaluation of Bayes factors is limited to this
specific model.

## The default Bayes factor

## The distribution of Bayes factors

The following plot illustrates the distribution of the default Bayes
factor when assuming an effect size of *d* = 0.2, which is a small
effect. 


```{r}

sim_data <- get(load("./data/BF.data"))

quantiles_02_def <- BF_quantiles(BF02_def, c(0.2, 0.5, 0.8))
plot_BF_quantiles(quantiles_02_def, thresholds)

```
