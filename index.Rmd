Lately, I have been trying to create all of my documents (presentations, manuscripts,
examinations...) using R Markdown. While R Markdown is incredibly useful, it has its
limitations. In particular, R Markdown is relying on functionality of other software
(Latex, pandoc), which sometimes need to be addressed directly to achieve your goal.

Below are some texts on my journey with R Markdown and the difficulties that I dealt
with. I do not claim to be an expert on R Markdown; I am simply writing about stuff
that I found curious. Usually I found solutions by googling and trial and error --
there is no garantee that presented solutions are optimal.
