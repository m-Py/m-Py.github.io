I am Martin Papenberg, working as a post-doc researcher at the the 
department of [Psychological Assessment and Differential 
Psychology](http://www.psychologie.hhu.de/en/research-teams/ 
psychological-assessment-and-differential-psychology.html) at [Heinrich 
Heine University 
Düsseldorf](https://www.uni-duesseldorf.de/home/en/home.html). I am 
interested in measurement, personality[^diss] and programming[^R], 
among others.

Currently, I am primarily working on the `R` package 
[`anticlust`](https://github.com/m-Py/anticlust) package that enables 
the automatic selection of stimuli for psychological experiments. Check 
out my latest preprint on the anticlustering method: [Using 
anticlustering to partition a stimulus pool into equivalent 
parts](https://psyarxiv.com/3razc/).

[^diss]: My doctoral dissertation dealt with personality influences on 
test achievement, see [On how testwiseness and acceptance reluctance 
influence the validity of sequential knowledge 
tests](https://docserv.uni-duesseldorf.de/servlets/DocumentServlet?id=46569).

[^R]: For example, I wrote an introduction to the statistical 
programming language [R](https://cran.r-project.org/), [available for 
free here](https://osf.io/nghyv/) (in German language).
