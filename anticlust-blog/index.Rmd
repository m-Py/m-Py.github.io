This is the blog about the [anticlust R package](https://github.com/m-Py/anticlust). Here I share
some thoughts and stuff on the anticlust package that do not really fit into the documentation and
vignettes (even though materials gathered here may be used there in the future). It will often be 
concerned with the internal details of anticlust that may not be of primary interest to its users.
