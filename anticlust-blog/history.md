When working on the problem in more depth for my [Bachelor thesis in Computer science](https://www.cs.hhu.de/fileadmin/redaktion/Fakultaeten/Mathematisch-Naturwissenschaftliche_Fakultaet/Informatik/Algorithmische_Bioinformatik/Bachelor-_Masterarbeiten/BA-Papenberg.pdf), we realized that this problem can be tackled by optimizing a reversed clustering criterion. Only shortly before submitting my thesis, I actually found the reference by Sp√§th (1986) who already coined the term anticlustering for optimizing a different anticlustering criterion. When we submitted our own anticlustering paper (Papenberg & Klau, 2021), it even turned out during review that the method we "invented" was actually known as the maximum diverse grouping problem (MDGP) in operations research. Furthermore, a few weeks before we submitted our paper (which was not known to me), the first anticlustering paper in a psychological journal was published (Brusco et al., 2020). Brusco et al. had also identified that the MDGP can be understood as an anticlustering problem because it corresponds to the reversal of a classical clustering criterion. So, in the revised and then published version, we acknowledge these prior contributions.
