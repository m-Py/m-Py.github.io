I just read the following statement on alpha error thresholds in a paper
on multiple comparisons:

"In other words, by setting [the alpha level] to 5%, researchers accept
a 5% chance that they will falsely conclude there is an effect."

This is not true. "Falsely conclude there is an effect" means that (1)
we conclude there is an effect and (2) there is no effect. By laws of
probability we have: p(conclude effect AND no effect) = p(conclude
effect | no effect) * p(no effect), which is 5% multiplied by the base
rate of null effects, which is not 1. This means that I erroneously
conclude the presence of an effect less often than my nominal alpha
level indicates.
