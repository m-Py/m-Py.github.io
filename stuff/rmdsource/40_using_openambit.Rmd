The following configuration works for me to synchronize my Suunto ambit watch data with my computer. Currently I am using Kubuntu 22.04 (LTS release).

Pull the latest sources from https://github.com/openambitproject/openambit (at the time of writing the latest commit is `a3ebe71`, and the development seems to be stale based on the latest commit message).

Follow the installation from source instructions in the README:

- Get the required development packages

`sudo apt-get install debhelper gcc g++ make cmake libusb-1.0-0-dev libudev-dev qtbase5-dev qttools5-dev-tools zlib1g-dev libpcap-dev libglib2.0-dev wireshark-dev qttools5-dev`

- Build:

```
cd /path/to/your/clone/of/openambit
./build.sh -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```

To remove the "permission denied" message when running the GUI via `./run.sh` or `./run.sh openambit`, use

```
sudo cp ./src/libambit/libambit.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
```

See [this issue](https://github.com/openambitproject/openambit/issues/261) on their Github page. Or maybe use `sudo make install` in the sources directory.

Now just use the GUI to synchronize data, it seems to store the XML files in `~/.openambit` by default.
