title: "No RStudio"
author: "by Martin Papenberg"

Here I share some thoughts and write up things that interest me. It is
usually about <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/" target="_blank"> R
Markdown </a>or other <a href="https://www.r-project.org/"
target="_blank">R</a>-related stuff.

With regard to the title: I love RStudio and I believe that the RStudio 
company has been incredibly important for the development of `R` in the 
recent years. I also advise every `R` newby to work with RStudio -- 
everything "just works", and RStudio includes helpful features for 
useRs on all levels. However, I also like to tinker around and try 
stuff in unconventional ways. This includes trying out different 
environments for working with `R` and R Markdown.
