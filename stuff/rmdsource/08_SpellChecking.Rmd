When using text editors or email programs in Ubuntu, spell checking is 
usually enabled (for example when using [Kate](https://kate-editor.org/) 
or [rkward](https://rkward.kde.org)), but a native dictionary may not be 
available. A german dictionary can be installed as follows:

```
$ sudo apt install aspell-de
```

## Support for R Markdown / Latex

Related -- to include other language support in R Markdown / Latex, use:

```
sudo apt-cache search texlive german
sudo apt install texlive-lang-german
```

Then, include this in the YAML header of an R Markdown document:

```YAML
header-includes:
  - \usepackage[german]{babel}
```
