When using text editors or email programs in Ubuntu, spell checking is 
usually enabled (for example when using [Kate](https://kate-editor.org/) 
or [rkward](https://rkward.kde.org), but a native dictionary may not be 
available. A german dictionary can be installed as follows:

```
$ sudo apt install aspell-de
```
