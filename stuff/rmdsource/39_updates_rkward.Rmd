This is an update on my current configurations in [Rkward](https://rkward.kde.org/).

Related old posts: [1](https://m-py.github.io/stuff/35_rsyntax.html), [2](https://m-py.github.io/stuff/34_ctags-2.html), [3](https://m-py.github.io/stuff/36-kate_ds.html), [4](https://m-py.github.io/stuff/07_SettingUpKate.html)

Use VI-mode in editor to execute code blocks, then add two key bindings:

Normal mode: `<s-c-c>`: `V { <c-cr> <esc> }`

Insert mode: `<s-c-c>`: `<esc> } V { <c-cr> <esc> } i`

I also enjoy replacing Control-Enter with q in visual mode (i.e. when a variable is marked in the editor), set `q` to `<c-cr>` in visual mode.

Using Control-Shift-C we can now execute an entire code block instead of a single line. Also, we can use vim editing commands. For me, this seems to work better than combining [Kate with VI commands for R](https://m-py.github.io/stuff/36-kate_ds.html).

Morever, ensure that a key binding for dynamic line break is set (I use Control-Alt-Z). Otherwise, it is also possible to use [VI mode for hard line breaks](https://m-py.github.io/stuff/36-kate_ds.html).
