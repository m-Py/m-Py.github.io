title: "Useful `knitr` options"

These are useful `knitr` options for starting an R Markdown document:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

library(knitr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message=FALSE, warning = FALSE) # echo = FALSE
options(scipen = 999, digits = 2)

```

I always got wrong that `digits` is in `options()` and not 
`opts_chunk$set()`. The option `scipen = 999` disables the horrible 
scientific number printing.

Don't forget to include the following in the YAML header to ensure that 
data frames are printed nicely:

```YAML
output:
  html_document:
    df_print: kable
```
