CTags is a tool that can make your text editor "understand" code. Most 
importantly (at least for me), I can use it to jump to function definitions, a 
feature that is enabled by default in more "advanced" programming IDEs. 

This is how to use Ctags in the KDE text editor [Kate](https://kate-editor.org/): 

- [Install Ctags](https://askubuntu.com/questions/383762/how-to-configure-ctags-in-kate?newreg=8d72ea3598cf4f44b023303500500bed), 
on Ubuntu using:

```
$ sudo apt-get install exuberant-ctags 
```

- Activate Ctags
  * Settings 
  * Configure Kate
  * Plugins 
  * *Click the Ctags button*

- In the Ctags button on the bottom, go to 'Index targets', select your project 
directory
- Define custom key bindings for `katectags` to go to functions definitions and 
declarations (including a mouse click does not seem to work for custom key 
binding, unfortunately)

### Adding support for the R language

By default, Ctags does not support the R language. It is however rather easily 
added, as described by [Fong Chun Chan](https://tinyheero.github.io/about/) 
[here](https://tinyheero.github.io/2017/05/13/r-vim-ctags.html). That is,
just add the following lines to a file `.ctags` in your home directory. 

```
--langdef=R
--langmap=r:.R.r
--regex-R=/^[ \t]*"?([.A-Za-z][.A-Za-z0-9_]*)"?[ \t]*(<-|=)[ \t]function/\1/f,Functions/
--regex-R=/^"?([.A-Za-z][.A-Za-z0-9_]*)"?[ \t]*(<-|=)[ \t][^f][^u][^n][^c][^t][^i][^o][^n]/\1/g,GlobalVars/
--regex-R=/[ \t]"?([.A-Za-z][.A-Za-z0-9_]*)"?[ \t]*(<-|=)[ \t][^f][^u][^n][^c][^t][^i][^o][^n]/\1/v,FunctionVariables/
```

Then, you can jump to function definitions within a project; neat for working on 
R packages. I am not sure if Ctags can also be enabled in the R environment 
[rkward](https://rkward.kde.org) that uses kate as its editor. It is possible to 
go via `Settings` to `Configure rkward` to `Kate Plugins`. There, Ctags can be 
activated. However, I did not find out if you can define custom key bindings 
again for easy access to Ctags functionality (or any way to access Ctags 
functionality within the code editor).
