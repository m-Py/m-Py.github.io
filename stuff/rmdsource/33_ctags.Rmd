title: "Make your text editor understand code: How to use CTags in Kate"

[CTags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctags) is a tool that can make your text 
editor "understand" code. Most importantly (at least for me), I can use it to 
jump to function definitions, a feature that is enabled by default in more 
"advanced" programming IDEs. 

This is how to use Ctags in the KDE text editor [Kate](https://kate-editor.org/): 

- [Install Ctags](https://askubuntu.com/questions/383762/how-to-configure-ctags-in-kate?newreg=8d72ea3598cf4f44b023303500500bed), 
on Ubuntu using:

```
$ sudo apt install exuberant-ctags 
```

- Activate Ctags
  * Settings 
  * Configure Kate
  * Plugins 
  * *Click the Ctags button*

- In the Ctags button on the bottom, go to 'Index targets', select your project 
directory
- Define custom key bindings for `katectags` to go to functions definitions and 
declarations (including a mouse click does not seem to work for custom key 
binding, unfortunately)
