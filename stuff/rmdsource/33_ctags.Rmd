CTags is a tool that can make your text editor "understand" code. Most 
importantly, for me, I can use it to jump to function definitions, a feature 
enabled by default in programming IDEs. This is how to use Ctags in Kate: 

- [Install Ctags](https://askubuntu.com/questions/383762/how-to-configure-ctags-in-kate?newreg=8d72ea3598cf4f44b023303500500bed)

```
$ sudo apt-get install exuberant-ctags 
```

- Activate Ctags
  * Settings 
  * Configure Kate
  * Plugins 
  * *Click the Ctags button*

- In the Ctags button on the bottom, go to 'Index targets', select your project directory
- Define custom key bindings for `katectags` to go to functions definitions and declarations
(including a mouse click does not seem to work for custom key binding, unfortunately)
