### Merging

When working on a development branch that has to be merged into a 
master branch and -- for some stupid reason -- clean merging does not
work, use git merge with the option `ours`:

```
$ git merge branch -X ours
```

This is better than the option suggested by Github if a pull request 
fails and they suggest to resort to the command line; when following
their instructions, it may be necessary to resolve conflicts manually,
which is error prone.

### Stashing

[Stashing](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Git-Tools-Stashing) is 
something different than staging; stashing can be done to not commit 
dirty changes, for example if we wish to switch to a different branch 
before we have finished our work. Staging is the more common process 
done via `git add`. Files can be stashed using `git stash` and retrieved
using `git stash pop`.

### Setting up a new branch

Simply via:

```
$ git branch newbranch
```

To switch the the new branch, do not use the `branch` command (according
to the help file, the `branch` command only lists, creates, or deletes 
branches), but the checkout command:

```
$ git checkout newbranch
```

If you have made changes in one branch but would like to work in the 
other branch, one option is stashing:

```
$ git stash
$ git checkout branch2
$ git stash pop
```

### Removing an obsolete remote

When performing a merge pull request on Github (and afterwards deleting 
the obsolete devel branch there), the local repository will still 
believe that the branch exists remotely. Use the following commands to 
first remove the branch locally and then the reference to the remote 
branch:

```
$ git branch -d devel
$ git fetch --prune
```

The latter command removes the remote reference from the local 
repository.
