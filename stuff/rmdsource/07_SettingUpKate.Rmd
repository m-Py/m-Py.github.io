title: "Setting up R Markdown on Kubuntu"

After some time I returned to [KDE](https://kde.org/) (in particular, to 
[Kubuntu](https://kubuntu.org/)). I had always liked its style, but 
unfortunately I always had some problems with stability in previous 
versions. With the most recent version 19.10, everything is running 
smoothly. 

Why is Kubuntu good for writing in R Markdown? First, by default it 
ships the awesome text editor [Kate](https://kate-editor.org/) that has 
nice R Markdown syntax highlighting,[^atom] spell checking (enabled by 
default), and syntax highlighting for math equations. Second, KDE offers 
the powerful `R` IDE [RKward](https://rkward.kde.org) that includes Kate 
as its code editor. Even better, RKward can be used from any operating 
system, not just from Kubuntu or other Linux systems. I really encourage 
everyone to try it out, if just to see an alternative to RStudio once in 
a while.

[^atom]: In general, writing in R Markdown now seems to be much more 
comfortable than some years back. The [atom editor](https://atom.io/) 
also includes a nice mode for R Markdown documents. However, for now I 
prefer Kate. 

As said, Kate should be included by default in the Kubuntu repository.
If you are using a different Ubuntu flavor, the following works:

```
$ sudo apt install kate
```

RKward can be installed using the standard Ubuntu repository:

```
$ sudo apt install rkward
```

Note that this version will be slightly outdated, and more recent 
versions are available through the launchpad project (see "Inofficial 
Ubuntu repositories" 
[here](https://rkward.kde.org/Binaries_and_Build_Scripts.html)).

### Document preview

In the latest version (v0.7.1) of RKward, it is possible to activate 
document preview for R Markdown documents. This is actually a nice 
advantage over RStudio. It will only preview html documents, but I think 
for the purpose of editing the writing this should be enough. I even 
heard that pdf preview is on the maybe-to-do list.

To activate the Preview mode, click the Preview button in the tool bar. 
If this button does not appear by default, go to `Settings -> Configure 
Toolbars -> mainToolBar <rkward_commandeditor>`. In this menu, drag 
`Preview` to `Current Actions`. Now, if you click `Preview` in the tool 
bar above the text editor, a html version of your R Markdown document 
will be rendered whenever you save your file. It looks like this:

<img src = "../img/rkward.png" width = 850 alt = "Live preview of R Markdown documents in RKward">

### Additional more notes on R Markdown and RKward 

One minor problem with RKward is that it does not really "understand" 
what R Markdown files are (damn new stuff). When opening an Rmd file, it 
is sometimes necessary to manually set the syntax highlighting to R 
Markdown -- RKward thinks it is dealing with an R script when it 
actually handles an Rmd file. This is easy, however. Just select the 
button in the bottom right of the screen where syntax highlighting can 
be changed to "R Markdown".

To ensure that RKward shows Rmd files when you use the file browser when 
opening a file, define the file extensions ".rmd" and ".Rmd" as R script 
file extensions (RKward does not yet "understand" that Rmd files are 
actually valid R files). To this end, go via `Settings -> Configure 
RKward -> Script editor`. Here, add `*.rmd *.Rmd` to `R script file 
filters`.

### Setting hard line breaks in Kate

As discussed [here](05_setUpRMDemacs.html), I prefer hard line breaks as 
opposed to soft breaks. Any text editor I use for writing R Markdown 
should include functionality for hard line breaks. Fortunately, Kate 
(and hence, RKward) does. However, we first have to define a custom 
shortcut for this functionality. This is done via `Settings -> Configure 
Shortcuts -> Apply Word Wrap`. I use `Alt-Q` to insert hard line wraps.

### Useful Kate features

- Focus the Terminal: `F4` (goes back as well)
- Recognizes git repositories as project, the developers even plan to 
integrate git better in Kate in the future (see 
[here](https://kate-editor.org/post/2019/2019-10-20-git-client-
integration/))
- Set the column limit for hard line breaks: 
  `Settings -> Configure Kate -> Editing -> Wrap Words at`
- You can adjust Kate settings from within RKward as well
