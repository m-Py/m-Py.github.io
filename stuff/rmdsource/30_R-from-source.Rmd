Before uploading a package to CRAN, it has to be tested using a recent
development version of `R` that has to be installed from source:

> Please ensure that R CMD check --as-cran has been run on the tarball 
to be uploaded before submission. This should be done with the current 
version of R-devel (or if that is not possible and explained in the 
submission, current R-patched or the current release of R.) -- CRAN 
Repository Policy

# Unexpected dependencies for installing R from source

Appendix A1 "Essential programs and libraries" in "R Installation and 
Administration" contains requisite packages for installation from source.
Interestingly, Java is necessary to build R from source:

```
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
```

Some dependencies are needed to build the documentation in pdf format using Latex. The following packages are for example needed:

- `texi2dvi`, available via

```
sudo apt install texinfo
```

`qpdf`, available via

```
sudo apt install qpdf
```

Cairo is also needed for images in vignettes, via 

```
sudo apt install libcairo2-dev
```

# Installing `R` from source

1. Download the development version from https://cran.r-project.org/ 
$\to$ R Sources
2. Unpack the sources: 

```
tar -xf R-devel.tar.gz
```

3. Go to directory and check out the file INSTALL and 
doc/html/R-admin.html $\to$ "R Installation and Administration"

```
cd R-devel
```

4. 

```
./configure 
```

[However, just using `./configure` may not work](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17473547/error-with-readline-yes-default-and-headers-libs-are-not-available):

> Unless you do not want to view graphs on-screen (or use macOS) you need 
‘X11’ installed, including its headers and client libraries. For recent 
Fedora/RedHat distributions it means (at least) RPMs ‘libX11’, 
‘libX11-devel’, ‘libXt’ and ‘libXt-devel’. On Debian/Ubuntu we recommend 
the meta-package ‘xorg-dev’. If you really do not want these you will 
need to explicitly configure R without X11, using --with-x=no. -- 
Appendix A1 in "R Installation and Administration"

Then, we need: 

```
./configure --with-x=no
```

Or: 

```
./configure --with-readline=no --with-x=no --with-cairo
```

5. 

```
make
```

6. 

```
make check
```

Tests if the installation was successful.

7. `R` can now be started using the script `R` in directory `bin`:

```
cd bin
./R
```

8. It is also possible to install `R` devel on the system by using 

```
make install
```

but I guess this is not recommended because this replaces 
the current stable installation of `R`. [However, it is also possible 
to have multiple `R` versions at the same 
time.](https://docs.rstudio.com/resources/install-r-source/)

# Installing dependency packages

To test your package using `R CMD check`, you need to make the 
dependencies of your packages available to `R` devel. That is, install 
all of the packages in `Imports`, `Depends`, and `Suggests`.

Installing packages is actually accomplished by just using 
`install.packages()`. Packages will be installed into the directory in 
the `R` variable `.Library`, which was `R-devel/library` in my case.
Thus, these packages do not mess with your normal package libraries.

# Building the package using `R` devel

```
cd bin
./R CMD build "path/to/package"
```

Be sure to replace `path/to/package` by the actual path to the package 
on your system.

# Checking the package

```
./R CMD check --as-cran tar-ball.tar.gz
```

# On Windows

Some extra work may be required to check your package on a Windows 
system. Fortunately, at least, we can use `R CMD build` and `R CMD 
check` in the RStudio terminal. I had to get latex running so that `R 
CMD check` can build the pdf manuals. First, we have to install 
[Miktex](miktex.org). After installing Miktex, a restart is required so 
`R` finds the path to Latex.

Before `R CMD check` worked properly, however, I had to enable some 
fonts as described 
[here](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/125274/error-font-ts1-zi4r-at-540-not-found):

```
initexmf --update-fndb
initexmf --edit-config-file updmap
```

The second command opens the text editor where we put:

```
Map zi4.map
```

Last, we type

```
initexmf --mkmaps
```

into the console. Then, `R CMD check` should work.

I did not try to install R devel from source though on Windows, but 
used the released version.
