title: "Use {.allowframebreaks} to show the complete reference list in Beamer slides"

When using beamer slides and a bibliography that automatically creates references at
the end (i.e. on the last slide) of your presentation, not all references will be
shown. Instead, references that do not fit on the slide will be truncated. Depending
on your font size that means if you have more than four to six references, not all
references are included. To prevent this unfortunate behavior, add
{.allowframebreaks} to the title of the last slide:

```
# References {.allowframebreaks}

here be citations
```

Unfortunately,
[this is not enough](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35677857/references-truncated-in-beamer-presentation-prepared-in-knitr-rmarkdown/35684375). To
allow reasonable slide breaks between citations you also need to add the following to
your YAML header:

```
header-includes:
  - \widowpenalties 1 150
```

An additional trick: to indent citations in [APA (6th) style](http://apastyle.org/) use

```
# References {.allowframebreaks}

\setlength{\parindent}{-0.5in}
\setlength{\leftskip}{0.5in}
\setlength{\parskip}{8pt}
```
